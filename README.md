## What is Spotinder?
Spotinder is a **Spotify playlist cleaner** that helps you decide which songs you still love and which ones you’re ready to move on from.  
Instead of scrolling endlessly through your playlists, Spotinder gamifies the process: think of it as “Tinder for your music.”

## How it Works
1. Export your Spotify playlist as text (`Artist - Song` format).  
   - You can use a service like [[Chosic]](https://www.chosic.com/spotify-playlist-exporter/) to generate this list.  
2. Load the text list into Spotinder.  
3. The app plays a short **snippet of each track**.  
   - **Swipe right** (or click right arrow) → keep the song.  
   - **Swipe left** (or click left arrow) → mark it for removal.  

At the end of your run, Spotinder presents you with all the **songs you disliked** so you can clean up your playlist. Perfect for removing tracks you’ve gotten bored of.

## Features
- 🎵 **Song Snippets**: Quickly preview each track before deciding.  
- 👉 **Swipe UI**: Inspired by dating apps for a fun and intuitive experience.  
- 🎚 **Volume Slider & Progress Bar**: Control your listening experience.  
- 🧹 **Playlist Cleanup**: See all disliked songs at the end, ready to remove from Spotify.  
- ✨ **Clean, Modern Design**: Simple and smooth user experience.  

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Paste in your playlist text (`Artist - Song` format).  
4. Start swiping through your music collection!  
OR
Use the already existing website instead of deploying: https://spotinder.tiiny.site

## Example Use Case
- You’ve had the same playlist for months.  
- Some songs don’t hit the same anymore.  
- Spotinder lets you preview and swipe through your playlist, keeping what you love and discarding what you’re bored of.
